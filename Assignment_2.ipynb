    "# To solve the assignment, we need to perform a series of steps to build and evaluate a decision tree model using the provided diabetes dataset. Here is a structured approach to complete the assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Step-by-Step Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Import the Dataset and Examine the Variables**:\n",
    "#     - Load the dataset from the given link.\n",
    "#     - Use descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Preprocess the Data**:\n",
    "#     - Clean missing values.\n",
    "#     - Remove outliers.\n",
    "#     - Transform categorical variables into dummy variables if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Split the Dataset**:\n",
    "#     - Split the dataset into training and test sets.\n",
    "#     - Use a random seed to ensure reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. **Train a Decision Tree Model**:\n",
    "#     - Use a decision tree algorithm to train a model on the training set.\n",
    "#     - Use cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. **Evaluate the Model**:\n",
    "#     - Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n",
    "#     - Use confusion matrices and ROC curves to visualize the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. **Interpret the Decision Tree**:\n",
    "#     - Examine the splits, branches, and leaves of the decision tree.\n",
    "#     - Identify the most important variables and their thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. **Validate the Model**:\n",
    "#     - Apply the model to new data or test its robustness to changes in the dataset.\n",
    "#     - Use sensitivity analysis and scenario testing to explore uncertainty and risks.\n",
